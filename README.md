## My process
I started with the basic homepage and the layout, once I was happy with the main layout I decided to work on getting the fake API to work, after that worked on the Filters and had a really hard time with it, I had to go get some help on google. But I manage to get part of it working, had to scavenge on other people code and adapt my code and components. After making that work, I started adding some media queries for the mobile responsiveness.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
### What I learned

I reinforced my knowledge on styled components and learned a lot how they work. I learned that thinking a lot before making stuff can save you SO MUCH TIME. In general I've learned a lot of React since I'm still learning the tech. Had to do a LOT of research, look into another people code and try many thing before it started to work.

### Continued development

I want to continue using React as a framework and styled components, I also want to learn a lot more about filtering and how to make smaller components.

## Acknowledgments

If you get stuck, dont excite on going ou asking for help and looking other people code, this is how you grow as a Dev. Also keep making projects, this is the best way to learn. I've spent a good amount of time in Tutorial Hell, my advice is make a GOOD tutorial about the topic you want, the more in depth the better and THEN go make projects, have lots of fun!
